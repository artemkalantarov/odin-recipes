    <h3>Grilled Salmon Marinade</h3>
    <p>There are plenty of delicious ways to marinate fish for grilling, but we're partial to this sweet and savory salmon marinade: Salmon filets are seasoned with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt, then marinated in a delicious combination of the following ingredients: soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil. Make sure to let the filets marinate in the fridge for at least two hours to reach their full flavor potential.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
    <ul class="ingridients">
        <li>1 ½ pounds salmon fillets</li>
        <li>lemon pepper to taste</li>
        <li>garlic powder to taste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Season salmon fillets with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Stir soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil together in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Place fish in a large resealable plastic bag; add soy sauce mixture, seal, and turn to coat. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Place salmon on the preheated grill, and discard marinade. Cook salmon until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 6 to 8 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
